- Be able to recognize a constructor
- Be able to identify legal and illegal declaration and initialization
- Be able to use var correctly
- Be able to determine where variables fo out of scope
- Know how to identify when an object is eligible for garbage collection


Review Questions:
1) B, E, G - Good
2) G(D,F,G. d - boolean initilizes to false, F- Object references initialize to null)
3) B, D, H (B, D, E, H. E - E is a valid numeric expression)
4) A, D, E (A, B, D, E. B - 2.0 is double literal value, not integral type)
5) A, D - Good
6) C, E - Good
7) G - Good 
8) B, E - Good 
9) C, E, F - Good 
10) C - Good 
11) D, E - (A, D, E. A - var is not reserved and can be used as identifier)
12 ) H - (A, E, F . A) - check again
13) B, D, H - Good
14) B, F, G (B,C,F - C - var can not be used for instance or class variable.) 
15) G (C, F, G - C, F - 0b is prefix for binary and 0x is prefix for hexa. These can be assiged to primitives including int and foble) 
16) A, C, D - Good
17) A, B, F, G (A, E, F, G - E variables declared in loops are accesible only inside statement. B variables can be declared inside initializer blocks)
18) A, F, G - (F,G - Code does not complie so A, B, C and D are incorrect)
19) F - Good
20) H - (D - Initializer blocks are not called until the class is instantiated)
21) A, F (A, D, F )
22) C, D, E, (H - var cant be used as instance variable declarations)
